the final of project looks like this.I shared 2 different version of Tip Calculator project (if you look my repos you can see) in first one your input is the price of your tip.And in this one your input is the percent of tip.so if the total bill is 100$ and if you wanna give %10 percent tip the total bill is gonna be 110$.The logic of the project is that.

input's default data type is str but ım gonna make operation with numbers because of that ı need int data type.So ı added int before input.
str(10)+str(10)=1010 but int(10)+int(10)=20 in my opinion this is an important example to understand the difference between str and int.
